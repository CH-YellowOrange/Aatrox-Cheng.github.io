My name is Cheng Huang. Also, you can call me "Aatrox" (亚托克斯) ... Of course, I have a nickname: Yellow Orange.

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Department of Computer Science in Southern Methodist University. My research direction is AI for Health Care, especially glaucoma diagnosis and treatment.

I received my bachelor’s degree in Information Engineering from *University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)*. During my undergraduate studies, my research interests centered on **Memristors**, and **Medical Imaging**.

I received my master’s degree in Information Engineering from *the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)*. During my master studies, my research interests centered on **Medical Imaging**.

Unlike most excellent AI researchers, I am a "***garbage maker***". If you want to work with me, be prepared to be ripped off. Of course, if you don't mind leaving a stain on your resume, you can choose to communicate with me.

In the future, after finishing this boring Ph.D., I will study for a second Ph.D. on the intersection of bioinformatics and statistics. If you ask why, the first Ph.D. was just for finding a job and making a living, while the second one is the field I am really interested in.
